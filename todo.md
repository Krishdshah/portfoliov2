# Project TODO List

This file tracks potential features and improvements for the portfolio website.

## ðŸŒŸ High Priority Features

- [ ] **Finalize Content**: Replace all placeholder text, links (`#`), and project descriptions with final, production-ready content.

## âœ¨ Medium Priority Enhancements

- [ ] **Add a Testimonials Section**: Incorporate a small section with quotes from professors or collaborators to build social proof.
- [ ] **Add a Custom Favicon**: Create and add a personalized favicon to the `public` folder and link it in `index.html`.
- [ ] **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags (description, keywords) to `index.html` to improve search engine visibility.

## ðŸ’¡ Low Priority / Future Ideas

- [ ] **Interactive Command Line Theme**: Explore adding an optional "terminal mode" as a creative way to navigate the site.
- [ ] **Add a Custom Scrollbar**: Style the browser's scrollbar to better match the "cyber" theme.
- [ ] **Refine Mobile Animations**: Review all animations on various mobile devices and tweak them for optimal performance and smoothness.
